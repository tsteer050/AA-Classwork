# We want our dear user to be able to call convert_to_int 
# with no error being raised on invalid input. Update 
# convert_to_int to rescue any errors and return nil if 
# our argument cannot be converted.

# If we are handling the error thrown by Integer(arg),
#  which StandardError subclass should we be catching? Next,
#   update convert_to_int again to only rescue the correct
#    exception type.

# NB: rescue only rescues StandardError and its subclasses.
#  Any other Exception subclass is a system error and implies 
#  that something rather serious has gone wrong and our code should
#   stop executing.
